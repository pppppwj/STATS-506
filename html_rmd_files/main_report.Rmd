# Introduction

Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your body doesn't make or use the hormone insulin properly. In the past, doctors thought that only adults were at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, an increasing number of children in the United States are now being diagnosed with the disease. Doctors think this inrease is mostly because more children's eating habbits are unhealthy. And also, as people paying more attention to their body health nowadays, it is interesting to consider the effect of health insurance on people's eating habbits.
Therefore, we purposed a question relevant to both eatting habbits, health insurance and diabetes situations. Our question is:

**Do people's eating habbits have the same effect on their diabetes status with or without health insurance?**

To answer this question, we decide to first consider a bunch of diet elements in our analysis, and then use a penalized logistic model to help us select the important ones. In order to see whether the eating habbits' effect is different after considering the insurance, we first create new dietary variables interacted with insurance and then implement in our model.   

# Data

The data used is from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The specific datasets used are: 2015-2016 Demographic Variables and Sample Weights, 2015-2016 Health Insurance, 2015-2016 Diabetes, 2015-2016 Dietary Interview - Total Nutrient Intakes (First Day), and 2015-2016 Dietary Interview - Total Nutrient Intakes (Second Day). The following variables were used from the 2015-2016 Demographic Variables and Sample Weights dataset: respondent sequence number (seqn), age, gender, and income. From the 2015-2016 Health Insurance variables used were: respondent sequence number (seqn) and insurance (whether respondent was covered insurance or not). From the 2015-2016 Diabetes dataset, we selected the following variables: respondent sequence number (seqn) and doctor telling respondent if they had diabetes. Lastly, variables that were chosen from the 2015-2016 Dietary Interviews - Total Nutrient Intakes (First and Second Day) were:
Iron, Calcium, Zinc, Sodium, Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Alcohol, Vitamin C, Total fat, Dietary, fiber, Total sugars, Carbohydrate, Energy, and Protein. Full data is available [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx).


# Methods
**Logistic Regression with Lasso Penalty**

Diabete is a binary variable. For binary classification problems, linear logistic regression model is most often used. 
Although logistic regression often performs comparably to competing methods, such as support vector machine and linear 
discriminant analysis, it is chosen in this problem because of its several advantages. The notable advantages include 
that: it provides a direct estimate of class probability; it tends to be more robust in the case $k>>n$
since it makes no assumptions on the distribution of the predictors; and it doesn't need tuning parameters. The logistic regression model presents the class-conditional probabilities through a linear function of the predictors and is expressed as:


$$log(\frac{p}{1-p})=\beta_0+\sum_{i=1}^k{x_i\beta_i}$$


Logistic regression coefficients are typically estimated by maximizing the following binomial log-likelihood:

$$\max_{\beta}\sum_{i=1}^n{\{y_i(x_i^T\beta)-\log(1+\exp(x_i^T\beta))\}}$$


In order to select the variables and avoid overfitting, here we try to use logistic regression with lasso penalty.
Now it becomes to be estimated by minimizing the following formula:
$$\min_{\beta}\{-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{\{y_i(x_i^T\beta)-\log(1+\exp(x_i^T\beta))\}}+P_\lambda(\beta)\},P_\lambda(\beta)=\lambda\sum_{j=1}^k|\beta_j|$$

**ROC curve and AUC**

Because the data is unbalance. So we use AUC to judge our model.

|  | P(true) |  N(true)|
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| P'(predicted) |TP|FP| 
| N'(predicted) |FN |TN | 


ROC curve: Y-axis is TPR=TP/(TP+FN) , X-axis is FPR=FP/(FP+TN).   
AUC is value of area under ROC curve.  
Several equivalent interpretations of AUC:   
* The expectation that a uniformly drawn random positive is ranked before a uniformly drawn random negative.   
* The expected proportion of positives ranked before a uniformly drawn random negative.   
* The expected true positive rate if the ranking is split just before a uniformly drawn random negative.   
* The expected proportion of negatives ranked after a uniformly drawn random positive.   
* 1 â€“ the expected false positive rate if the ranking is split just after a uniformly drawn random positive.

### Data Cleaning
For the data cleaning part , I decide to use the dplyr package to help me solve it.
```{r data_clean}
# Demographic data
New_Demo_dat <-  Demographic_data %>%
                    select("id" = SEQN,

                            "age" = RIDAGEYR,
                            "income" = INDFMIN2) %>%
                    filter(!is.na(income) & income != 12 & income != 13 
                           & income != 77 & income != 99) %>%
                    transmute(id = id,
                              gender = factor(gender, labels =c("male","female")),
                              age_group = factor(ifelse(age < 13, 1, 
                                                        ifelse(age < 19,2,

                                                        ifelse(age < 60, 4, 5)))),
                                                 labels = c("younger", "teenager",
                                                            "adult", "seniors", "elder")),
                              income = factor(ifelse(income == 14 | income ==15, income - 2,
                                              income)))

# Insurance data

                    transmute(id = id,
                              insurance = ifelse(insurance == 1, 1, 0))

# diabetes data
# remove values other than 1 or 2, and change 2 to 0
New_Diabetes_dat <- Diabetes_data %>%
                        select("id" = SEQN, "diabetes" = DIQ010)%>%
                        filter(!is.na(diabetes) & diabetes != 3 & diabetes != 9) %>%
                        transmute(id = id,
                                  diabetes = ifelse(diabetes == 2, 0, 1))

## Day1 data
New_Day1_dat <- Day1_data %>%
                    select("id" = SEQN, "weight" = WTDRD1, "iron" = DR1TIRON,
                           "calcium" = DR1TCALC, "zinc" = DR1TZINC, "sodium" = DR1TSODI,
                           "VE" = DR1TATOC, "VA" = DR1TVARA, "VC" = DR1TVC,
                           "alcohol" = DR1TALCO, "fat" = DR1TTFAT, "fiber" = DR1TFIBE,
                           "sugar" = DR1TSUGR, "carbonhydrate" = DR1TCARB,
                           "energy" = DR1TKCAL, "protein" = DR1TPROT) %>%
                    filter(weight != 0) %>%
                    filter_at(vars(-c("id", "weight")), all_vars(!is.na(.))) %>%
                    # for data visualization part, we don't standaardize the variables
                    mutate_at(vars(-c("id", "weight")), scale)  %>%
                    mutate(survey_day = factor(1))

# Day2 data
New_Day2_dat <- Day2_data %>%
                    select("id" = SEQN, "weight" = WTDR2D, "iron" = DR2TIRON,
                           "calcium" = DR2TCALC, "zinc" = DR2TZINC, "sodium" = DR2TSODI,
                           "VE" = DR2TATOC, "VA" = DR2TVARA, "VC" = DR2TVC,
                           "alcohol" = DR2TALCO, "fat" = DR2TTFAT, "fiber" = DR2TFIBE,
                           "sugar" = DR2TSUGR, "carbonhydrate" = DR2TCARB,
                           "energy" = DR2TKCAL, "protein" = DR2TPROT) %>%
                    filter(weight != 0) %>%
                    filter_all(all_vars(!is.na(.))) %>%
                    # for data visualization part, we don't standaardize the variables
                    mutate_at(vars(-c("id", "weight")), scale) %>%
                    mutate(survey_day = factor(2))

# Merge all dataset together
Data_final <- New_Day1_dat %>%
                rbind(New_Day2_dat) %>% 
                    inner_join(New_Demo_dat, by = "id") %>%
                        inner_join(New_Diabetes_dat, by = "id") %>%
                            inner_join(New_Insur_dat, by = "id")
dim(Data_final)
```
So after cleaning process, I finally got a data with 13245 observations and 22 variables.

```{r show_data, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(Data_final[1:3,1:10], caption = "The head 3 rows and head 10 columns of final data ")
```

### Data Visualization
For better understanding the final data we got, we decide to do some visualization jobs, here I am going to plot the difference of average zinc iron and sodium intake amount between diabetes and non-diabetes groups at each level of people.
By ploting these data, we can directly understand the eating habbit's difference in microelements intake of people.  

```{r data_visualize, echo=FALSE}
New_Day1_dat <- Day1_data %>%
                    select("id" = SEQN, "weight" = WTDRD1, "iron" = DR1TIRON,
                           "calcium" = DR1TCALC, "zinc" = DR1TZINC, "sodium" = DR1TSODI,
                           "VE" = DR1TATOC, "VA" = DR1TVARA, "VC" = DR1TVC,
                           "alcohol" = DR1TALCO, "fat" = DR1TTFAT, "fiber" = DR1TFIBE,
                           "sugar" = DR1TSUGR, "carbonhydrate" = DR1TCARB,
                           "energy" = DR1TKCAL, "protein" = DR1TPROT) %>%
                    filter(weight != 0) %>%
                    filter_at(vars(-c("id", "weight")), all_vars(!is.na(.))) %>%
                    # for data visualization part, we don't standaardize the variables
                    #mutate_at(vars(-c("id", "weight")), scale)  %>%
                    mutate(survey_day = factor(1))

# Day2 data
New_Day2_dat <- Day2_data %>%
                    select("id" = SEQN, "weight" = WTDR2D, "iron" = DR2TIRON,
                           "calcium" = DR2TCALC, "zinc" = DR2TZINC, "sodium" = DR2TSODI,
                           "VE" = DR2TATOC, "VA" = DR2TVARA, "VC" = DR2TVC,
                           "alcohol" = DR2TALCO, "fat" = DR2TTFAT, "fiber" = DR2TFIBE,
                           "sugar" = DR2TSUGR, "carbonhydrate" = DR2TCARB,
                           "energy" = DR2TKCAL, "protein" = DR2TPROT) %>%
                    filter(weight != 0) %>%
                    filter_all(all_vars(!is.na(.))) %>%
                    # for data visualization part, we don't standaardize the variables
                    #mutate_at(vars(-c("id", "weight")), scale) %>%
                    mutate(survey_day = factor(2))

# Merge all dataset together
Data_final1 <- New_Day1_dat %>%
                rbind(New_Day2_dat) %>% 
                    inner_join(New_Demo_dat, by = "id") %>%
                        inner_join(New_Diabetes_dat, by = "id") %>%
                            inner_join(New_Insur_dat, by = "id")

## Compare the average microelement intake amount at each age, gender and 
## insurance level between day1 and day2.
data_nodiab <- Data_final1 %>%
    filter(diabetes == 0 & survey_day == 1) %>%
    select(c("weight", "age_group", "gender", "insurance","zinc",
             "iron", "sodium")) %>%
    group_by(age_group, gender, insurance) %>%
    summarise(avg_iron = sum(iron * weight) / sum(weight),
              avg_zinc = sum(zinc * weight) / sum(weight),
              avg_sodium = sum(sodium * weight) / sum(weight))

data_diab <- Data_final1 %>%
    filter(diabetes == 1 & survey_day == 1) %>%
    select(c("weight", "age_group", "gender", "insurance","zinc",
             "iron", "sodium")) %>%
    group_by(age_group, gender, insurance) %>%
    summarise(avg_iron = sum(iron * weight) / sum(weight),
              avg_zinc = sum(zinc * weight) / sum(weight),
              avg_sodium = sum(sodium * weight) / sum(weight))

data_combined <- data_nodiab %>%
    inner_join(data_diab, by = c("age_group", "gender", "insurance"),
               suffix = c("_nodb", "_db")) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -c("age_group", "gender", "insurance"),
                 names_to = c(".value", "diabetes"), 
                 names_pattern = "(avg_.*[_$])(db|nodb)") %>%
    mutate(group_id = paste(paste(age_group, substr(gender,1,1),sep = "_"), 
                            insurance, sep = "_"))


fig_zinc <- ggplot(data_combined, aes(x = group_id, y = avg_zinc_, fill = diabetes, 
                                      shape = diabetes, color = diabetes)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    geom_text(aes(label=round(avg_zinc_,1)), color = "black", 
              position = position_dodge(1), size=4) + coord_polar() +
    labs(y = "zinc amount(mg)", title = "Zinc(mg)", 
         subtitle = "Zinc intake amount(mg) among each group of people")

fig_iron <- ggplot(data_combined, aes(x = group_id, y = avg_iron_, fill = diabetes, 
                                      shape = diabetes, color = diabetes)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    geom_text(aes(label=round(avg_iron_,1)), color = "black", 
              position = position_dodge(1), size=4) + coord_polar() +
    labs(y = "Iron(mg)", title = "Iron(mg)", 
         subtitle = "Iron intake amount(mg) among each group of people")

fig_sodium <- ggplot(data_combined, aes(x = group_id, y = avg_sodium_, fill = diabetes, 
                                        shape = diabetes, color = diabetes)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    geom_text(aes(label=round(avg_sodium_)), color = "black", 
              position = position_dodge(1), size=3) + coord_polar() +
    labs(y = "Sodium(mg)", title = "Sodium(mg)", 
         subtitle = "Sodium intake amount(mg) among each group of people")
fig_iron
fig_zinc
fig_sodium
```

So, fron the above 3 graphs, we can see that:  
(1) For the iron intake, we can see there exist some difference between diabetes groups. Especially for the male adults(19-40) who don't have health insurance, the diabetes group would obvious overload iron intakes in their meals.  
(2) For the zinc intake, according to the research paper, zinc can somewhat have beneficial effect on preventing diabetes problem. That can be supported by my plot that for those male teenagers(13-18) with health insurance, the non-diabetes group tend to get more zinc intakes in their meals.  
(3) For the sodium intake, people with more salt intake will tend to have a blood pressure problem and maybe relevant to diabetes problem. So from my plot we can see that for the male teenager group with health insurance, those have diabetes taking more amount of sodium than those without diabetes.

### Modeling
we are going to build penalized logistic model for our question. And we implement cross validation methods to get lambda parameter; parallel computing method to improve efficiency; AUC value to evaluate our model performance.
```{r model1, echo=FALSE}

### Model Interpretation
According to the final model we got above, we only remain 14 variables that are important chosen by lasso method.

And then we can see that:  
(1) For sugar predictor, the coefficients of the original one and the insurance interacted one are both negative, that means if a person has much sugar intake in his/her meal, then it may have less chance to be told that he/she has a diabetes issue.  
(2) For age predictor, the coefficients of the elder people are negative, that means an elder person may be more likely to be told having a diabetes issue.  
(3) For income predictor, people with higher income tend to have less probability to get diabetes issue. That make sense because rich people maybe pay more attention to their health status.  
(4) For insurance interacted term, there are only sugar and sodium interacted remain in the model. And that can answer our main question: 

People with health insurance are **more likely** to have diabetes issue with same amount **sodium, iron, fat** intakes than those without insurance;  
And they are **less likely** to have diabetes issue with same amoount **VC, VE, sugar, alcohol, protein** intakes than those without insurance.

### Data visualization of VA VC and VE

![](C:/Users/95260/Desktop/stats506/group_project/STATS-506\html_rmd_files/py_pic/Vitamin_E.png)

As we can see from the above pictures, the intakes of vitamin A,C and E are almost the same in mostly group except for the group (teenage 13-18, male, with_ins) and the group (teenage 13-18, female, with_ins). It seems for me that vitamin A,C and E
do NOT play important roles in this model. Teenage with diabetes can not eat too much sugar, which push them to eat more fruits or vegetables.

### Model Interpretation
According to the final model we got above, we only remain 25 variables that are important chosen by lasso method.

As we can see form the coef_sorted picture: 
(1) The age plays an important role in the model. As people become older, they may take a greater risk to have a diabete. What interesting is that the income play a tricky role in this model. We can see at first when income increase, people have more risk to have a diabete. But after that as the imcome increase, people have lower risk to have a diabetes.   
(2) For sugar predictor, the coefficients of the original one and the insurance interacted one are both negative, that means if a person has much sugar intake in his/her meal, then it may have less chance to be told that he/she has a diabetes issue.   
(3) From the interaction terms, we can see sodium, iro, and fat are positive. And VC alcohol and VE are negative.

People with health insurance are **more likely** to have diabetes issue with same amount **sodium, iron, fat** intakes than those without insurance;  
And they are **less likely** to have diabetes issue with same amoount **VE, alcohol, VA** intakes than those without insurance.




## STATA

### Clean Data
Data was merged, cleaned, and dietary (food) variables were standardized. Additional insurance variable was added to account for opposite effect of having insurance in regards to consumption. Original and alternative variables were created to act as interactives to account for when having insurance and not having insurance.

### Data Visualization

To perform data visualization, people with diabates and without diabates were looked at by group according to age, gender, and insurance status. To assess differences in eating habits for selected nutrients (fat, carbohydrates, and sugar), the mean consumption of those nutrients were calculated by group.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Include plots for the data visulation of nutrients per group

### Model

Dataset is divided into ten training sets and 10 test sets. Then LASSO 10-Fold Cross-Validation is performed to obtain optimal lambdas. Lambda chosen was the one that minimizes loss measure.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
* Import Main Data Set
use main_data_modified.dta, clear
* Create 10 Training and 10 Test Data Sets
* Build Training Data - 80 % of Main Data Set
* Build Test Data - 20 % of Main Data Set
* Key:
* Training Data if "training" == 1
* Test Data if "training" == 0
forval v = 1/10 {
set seed 11`v'
gen random`v' = uniform()
sort random`v'
gen byte training`v' = _n <= 13245*.8
}
drop random*
save training_test_data, replace
* Use 10-Fold Cross-Validation with Logistic Regression on Training Data
* to obtain optimal lambda
* NOTE: Install "lassopack" "pdslasso" and "cvAUROC"
ssc install pdslasso
ssc install lassopack
ssc install cvAUROC
forval v = 1/10 {
cvlassologit diabetes gender-alcohol_alt if training`v' == 1, nfolds(10) seed(11`v') 
}
* Lambda Values (that minimize loss measure):
* 8.6141729 
* 15.424845
* 13.24682 
* 13.310124

Taking the average of the ten optimal lambdas we obtain: 15.8424198, which we use on the final model. We then obtain coefficients for the final model.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
* Fit final model with average lambda
* And calculate ROC to judge performance of model
* Average lambda = 15.84241989
* Average ROC Area = .76423

### Results

The LASSO Cross-Validation selected ten lambdas and the ten were averaged to find the lambda that will be used for the final model. Using LASSO logistic regression with a lambda of 15.84241989, we narrowed (shrunk) down our variables. The variables that were selected were:
gender, age, income, original sugars, alternative sugars, original fat, original vitamin e, alternative vitamin a, original vitamin c, original calcium, alternative calcium, orginal iron, original zinc, alternative zinc, original sodium, original alcohol, and alternative alcohol. The area under the ROC curve was found to be 0.8508, which tells us that the model performs well. We see that eating habits do in fact differ. We can see that the original sugars variable has a negative effect, thus we can say that people who have insurance are more likely not going to be told they have diabetes. Assessing the fat variable we can say that more fat consumption with insurance leads to a doctor telling an individual that they have diabetes. Similarly with Vitamin E consumption, with insurance, the chance of being told by a doctor that they have diabetes becomes smaller as they consume more. Similar interpretations can be done with the remaining variables. In addition, we can observe what our demographic variables tell us. For example, we see that people with a higher income are less likely to be told by their doctors that they have diabetes.

# Summary

# Discussion
During Cross-Validation method of picking the optimal lambda,
programming done in Python and R used the AUC to choose 
the optimal lambda whereas programming done in STATA used
the lambda that minimizes the loss measure. This is due to a limitation in STATA
that was encountered.
